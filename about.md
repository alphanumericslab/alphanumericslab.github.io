This document outlines how we work, collaborate, and grow as a team. It contains expectations, lab policies, and the lab's PI approach to mentorship and the PhD process. **Please read it carefully before joining the lab and refer back to it regularly.**

### PhD Process and Career Planning
A PhD is not about checking boxes, merely completing tasks or publising. It's about transforming into an independent, critical, and creative researcher. The true outcome of your PhD journey is not just your thesis or publications—it's you: a deeply trained professional equipped to identify real-world problems, propose novel ideas, rigorously test and validate solutions, and defend them with clarity and integrity. Equally important, you'll become a leader, effective communicator and team member—skills essential across all career paths, whether in academia, industry, policy, or entrepreneurship.

In my experience, different regions cultivate this transformation in different ways. In Europe and some other academic systems, PhD students often work on highly focused, well-defined research questions. Progress is measured based on specific program milestones—number and quality of publications, presentations, committee approvals—and once those are met, the path to defense is usually straightforward. The emphasis is on depth and individual contribution.

In the U.S. and similar systems, the PhD experience tends to be embedded in broader, collaborative lab efforts that align with institutional or even national priorities. You're not only solving a specific problem but also building tools, software, systems, or knowledge that extend beyond your dissertation. You're part of a team, contributing to a longer-term goal. In this model, the principal investigator's role is similar to that of a startup leader—constantly balancing grant writing, human resource management, strategic planning, and delivery. Your progress is intertwined with that ecosystem, and your work both depends on and supports the success of others.

There is no universal answer to the question of *when* to defend. You must meet the program's formal requirements and advisor's expectations and project commitments, but beyond that, it's a strategic decision—one that should align with your next steps. If you're targeting academic jobs or postdocs, defending earlier might help you enter the market at the right time. If you prefer to explore other avenues, there may be value in staying enrolled while finalizing applications, securing funding, or wrapping up publications. These decisions are not only academic or professional—they're personal. Life circumstances such as health, family, financial security, or immigration status may also play a major role. Share these with me early. Knowing your trajectory helps me plan ahead—whether for project continuity, lab funding, or future opportunities. The same applies to internships: please communicate your interests and timelines in advance so I can align lab work accordingly.

The PhD process is intellectually demanding and emotionally complex—don't carry the burden alone. If you're feeling disconnected from your project, struggling with your topic, or questioning whether this lab is right for you, speak up. We can explore adjustments, plan transitions, or even shift directions if needed. There are always options, and I'm here to help you find your path and move forward.


### Mentorship and Meetings
Mentorship is adjusted based on your year in the program. Junior students (undergraduate and master's students) get more frequent mentorship. For PhD students, in Year 1, we will have weekly one-on-one meetings. In Year 2, biweekly. Year 3, every three weeks. From Year 4 onward, we'll meet monthly (at that point through your PhD, you wouldn't want to meet with me that often anyway...). These are your one-on-one meetings with the PI and do not include research team meetings, classes, or general office hours. If you need extra time with me outside of these for research or non-research-related talks, reach out and we'll schedule it.

Plan ahead for any support you need. If you want me or other faculty to write a recommendation letter, let us know at least one month in advance. Send me your updated CV and a draft of what you want highlighted. This guideline applies to all future professional interactions with me or others—whether asking for letters, feedback, or endorsements, you should always provide context and help the recommender help you.

Make sure to have a professional CV and NIH/NSF biosketches available and up to date. Different funding opportunities may require biosketches of collaborators at the last moment, so you should always keep them updated.

Share your presentations with me at least one week before you present. For major milestones like your proposal, PhD defense, or competitive fellowships, share your materials one month ahead to give me time to provide feedback. Plan early and communicate early.

### Communication
If you email me and don't hear back right away or even up to a week, it's not a bad sign. You're probably on the right track and on top of your research, and I'm likely handling teaching, grants, reviews, or other obligations. If it's time-sensitive, follow up. If it's truly urgent, include “URGENT” in your email subject line. For major time-bound issues and deadlines, send a reminder after 24 hours. That's completely okay.

If we need to schedule a Zoom or call to discuss research, just send me an email first. *Please contact me by phone only for absolute emergencies*. You can call me anytime, 24/7, for personal emergencies like safety, family, health-related, or immigration issues. For medical emergencies, always call 911 first. Emory's [LGS Student Affairs](https://gs.emory.edu/guides/students/support.html) also has excellent resources you can refer to for counseling or in emergency situations.

### Research Environment
Projects in this lab belong to the lab, not individuals. This might sound strange, but all projects we do are team efforts funded by grants that we as a team (within and beyond our lab) worked hard to secure. Often, several students, postdocs, faculty, and collaborators have contributed to the preliminary data and hardware/software infrastructure behind a project. As you join, you build on what others started way before you joined, just like others will build on your work later. We all get credit for our contributions in publications and patents, but this is not a solo experience—the lab is a scientific enterprise just like a startup company. For the same reason, the intellectual property of the projects is owned by the lab and the people who contributed to it before and after others join the lab. The only exception is when the initiation of a project is by yourself or if you are funded by a fellowship or award that is independent of our existing projects. Please make sure to communicate this or any other intellectual property expectations, questions, or concerns before joining the lab or as we go.

Publication of code or data must be coordinated with the PI. All GitHub repositories for active projects will be private by default and may be made public based on funding agency policies or lab strategy. Patent and licensing rights are negotiated based on actual contributions. Authorship will follow standard academic guidelines based on contributions to the research question, design, implementation, analysis, and writing. Departing students remain on publications when their contributions are essential to the output.

### Expectations for Growth
Innovation is a key element of your future career. It is earned at the intersection of hard work, deep knowledge, exposure to challenges and new ideas, and conversations with your peers. As a graduate student or postdoc, you should be reading at least one scientific paper per day, within or beyond your research focus. This builds the depth and awareness you'll need to publish and go beyond your specific focus. Also, skim textbooks—at least one per week. Use the library, borrow hard copies; digital copies never remain in our minds like good old hard copies. When you read textbooks, start by skimming through the table of contents, picking your favorite chapters and sections, and digging deeper when needed. This is, of course, different from textbooks you use for courses with homework and specific course requirements.

Attend regular talks presented by labmates, and internal and external presenters. Listening to an hour-long talk is a unique opportunity to familiarize yourself with a new field or to extend your network.

Keep detailed notes from meetings—technical, talks, and career-related. Self-notes, especially handwritten ones, help track your development and remind you what needs to get done and the context in which you heard about a topic. Keep your notes organized in your cloud folder.

Your research focus will evolve. So will your skills and interests, the lab's needs, and the available funding. In the early years, especially during lab rotations, use this time to explore what you're good at and what you're excited about. If you want to shift directions, let me know. If possible, I'll help you do that—but note that shifts may take time due to current project deadlines or constraints, or may not be feasible.

Whether you're heading into academia or industry, plan your career early. The conferences/workshops you attend, the skills you develop, and the internships you pursue should align with your goals. In our one-on-one meetings, we'll discuss your future path and what you need to get there. But it's on you to initiate those plans and stay on top of them.

## Work-Life Balance
I do not expect mentees to work on weekends or holidays as our general practice. However, academic and research work can be unpredictable, and it's not always possible to draw clear boundaries or fully unplug outside office hours. There may be times—such as grant application deadlines or critical project milestones—when work extends beyond office hours. These situations should be occasional and generally planned. During regular work hours, I expect full availability. It is your responsibility to manage your time effectively and maintain a healthy and realistic work-life balance. Please let me know in advance if you need to take a day (or more) off. If you are on a student visa, please ensure that you comply with [Emory's ISSS](https://isss.emory.edu/) guidelines before planning any travel.


### Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs (like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and others) are indeed helpful and time saving for writing, coding, brainstorming, and summarizing. You are welcome to use them where appropriate. But use them *intentionally* and with caution.

LLMs should *not* replace your essential skills—research design, scientific reasoning, problem solving, coding, writing, critical thinking, or professional communication. These are core to your future career success, and tools cannot replace them. You're training to become a *doctor of philosophy*—someone who can independently design and evaluate research, generate ideas, and execute them. If you outsource that to an LLM, you're not learning the skills you need—and when everyone else has access to the same AI-powered tools, you become replaceable.

LLMs are not a shortcut to expertise. Use them as accelerators, not substitutes, and make sure to obtain the skills to evaluate their outputs.

The AI landscape is evolving very rapidly; but in my opinion, the academic and professional world still demands real fluency in theory, research, engineering and technical writing. If you graduate without mastering these, you'll find yourself outpaced by peers who practiced problem solving, thinking critically, and collaborating meaningfully. Use LLMs to support your learning and building irreplaceable skills.

### Technical Onboarding
When you join a project, the PI will share a cloud-hosted folder with you (on Google Drive or OneDrive). Use this folder to store all your reports, presentations, notes, and related documents. We host LaTeX documents, reports, and manuscripts on Overleaf, and codebases are exclusively hosted on GitHub.com under the lab organization.

Keep everything organized in the folders, and do not create duplicate or disorganized copies. For each project, maintain a single slide deck that you update as you go. When providing progress updates, add them to that deck and refer to it in your email. Do not send slide decks as email attachments. Always keep the master document online. We may pull them up and present them in meetings live. So keep them up to date and self-contained for presentation.

Send me your GitHub.com ID as soon as possible. The PI will create a private repository for you under the lab's GitHub organization. Push your code to that repository daily or several times a day as needed—even if the code is not complete. If it is on your laptop and not in the repo, it does not exist from the lab's perspective. When choosing whether to keep something local or push it to the cloud/GitHub, ask yourself: *“How much time can I afford to lose if my device crashes right now?”* If it's more than a few hours, cloud storage is not optional—it is mandatory lab practice. All results and code updates should be communicated by referring to your GitHub repo. Do not email code or data. No data, especially if patient-related, should be pushed to GitHub. The only exception is small, fully de-identified public samples used strictly for demo purposes. Make sure to seek permission for sharing any such samples before posting them online.

No PHI or sensitive medical data should leave HIPAA-compliant storage, such as Emory's OneDrive or the Emory BMI cluster. All cloud work must follow institutional data security requirements. If you are working on any PHI data on a local computer (with the PI's prior written/electronic approval), make sure that the computer's disk is encrypted. Check out how you can encrypt your computer depending on the OS.

Do not share any datasets over email. Push them to the appropriate cloud folder and link them in your communication. Whether on the cluster or on the cloud, never overwrite the original data folder. Source and destination (result) folders should always be separated.

All project documents and reports should live on Emory OneDrive, the BMI Google Workspace, or Overleaf. If you're writing a paper or tech report, use Overleaf and keep it shared with the PI and your collaborators. Documents should stay online until you're ready to submit them. Offline versions lead to confusion, incompatible copies, loss of updates, and inconsistencies.

When naming documents, avoid generic names like “Document,” “Final version,” or “My Fellowship copy v3,” etc. These are not searchable or meaningful a week from now. Use filenames that include your full name and the project or submission type. For example, "`reza-sameni-ecg-digitization-google-fellowship-2025`" or "`reza-sameni-phd-proposal-2024`". Do not date files/codes manually in the cloud; contemporary cloud platforms track all changes and commit/change times automatically. Only use dated filenames when downloading files for external submissions or archiving.

### Coding Practices
Push code to GitHub daily. Avoid hardcoded paths in your code. Do not write file paths like `/Users/alex/data`. Use relative paths or config files. Code must be reproducible by others in the lab and beyond.

Your code should not be written in isolation. It should be usable by the next person who joins the project and should be readable in the future by yourself and others. That means clean structure, documentation, modular design, and no reliance on local setups or local libraries. All data and code repositories must have a README file with the project title, contributors, setup/utilization procedures required to run the code, and a license file. No need for over-documentation. Just write it for your future self (in a week or months from now). We typically use the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) for our codebases, unless specified by the PI. Systematic programming is part of being a researcher, not just a coder.

### Code of Conduct
We are committed to maintaining an open, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone in the Alphanumerics Lab, in alignment with Emory University's policies on equity and nondiscrimination. This includes adherence to *Title IX*, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, as well as Emory's *Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy*, which prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, and other protected characteristics.

All lab members are expected to use inclusive language, respect differing perspectives, provide and receive constructive feedback professionally, and act with empathy, integrity, and accountability. Harassment, discrimination, sexual misconduct, retaliation, or other disruptive behavior—whether in person, online, or in lab communications—is not acceptable. Consequences for violations may include informal conversations, formal warnings, removal from lab activities, or further action as appropriate.

*Please note that faculty are mandatory Title IX reporters.* This means if a faculty member becomes aware of a situation that may involve a Title IX violation (e.g., sexual harassment, assault, or discrimination based on sex), they are legally required to notify Emory's Title IX office. The intent of this policy is to ensure access to support, resources, and a fair process. Emory's Title IX office maintains as much privacy as possible for both complainants and respondents—offering support without assumptions and protecting all parties involved.

Alleged violations may be reported confidentially to the lab PI or through official Emory channels, including the [Office of Equity and Compliance](https://equityandcompliance.emory.edu) and [Title IX staff](https://titleix.emory.edu).

Our lab values *transparency, collaboration, and mutual respect*. The research journey includes both rewarding and challenging moments. We are committed to supporting one another and upholding the highest standards of scientific and professional conduct.
