The [Alphanumerics Lab](https://alphanumericslab.github.io) is centered at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu) [Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI)](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html). Our research interests include the development of devices, algorithms and software for processing biomedical signals and data.
Together with our clinical associates, industrial collaborators, and partners labs, we are committed to providing solutions and developing operational systems for real-world biomedical applications.
The competence of our research team, the DBMI infrastructure and the unique access to clinical data at Emory University has provided us a unique opportunity to contribute to different areas of Biomedical Informatics. Our current areas of applications include cardiovascular systems and diseases, multimodal patient monitoring systems and mobile health systems.
