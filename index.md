The [Alphanumerics Lab](https://alphanumericslab.github.io) is centered at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu) [Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI)](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html). Our research interests include the development of devices, algorithms and software for the acquisition and processing of biomedical signals and data. Together with our clinical associates, industrial collaborators, and partners labs, we are committed to providing solutions and developing operational systems for real-world biomedical applications.

The competence of our research team, the DBMI infrastructure and the unique access to clinical data at Emory University has provided us a unique opportunity to contribute to different areas of Biomedical Informatics. Our current areas of applications include cardiovascular systems and diseases, multimodal patient monitoring systems, mobile and distributed health systems.

Some of the featured projects of our research lab and the job openings in our lab are highlighted in this page.
